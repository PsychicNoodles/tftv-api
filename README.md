TFTV-Api
========

A RESTful JSON api for teamfortress.tv. It uses simple_html_dom.php (http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/) to parse through HTML content, extracts relevant elements, and returns it as JSON.

The site is currently available at http://tftv-api.herokuapp.com. Going to that specific URL leads to the project Github page, http://psychicnoodles.github.io/tftv-api, which documents usage.

If you find any bugs or errors, please do not hesitate to contact me via email at mattori.birnbaum@gmail.com or on Steam at http://steamcommunity.com/id/PsychicNoodles.
